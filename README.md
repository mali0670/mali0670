- 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammed Ali BUĞDAY. I am from Turkey and I live in Karaman. I graduated from Gazi University department of Business Administration. I graduated from the department of business administration, but I realized that I was studying the wrong department. Because I loved the computer world and I had to concentrate on that. That's why I'm currently taking software training.
- 👀 I’m interested in history, science, sport and technology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web development with Java, Object Oriented Programming and Android mobile app development with Java
- 💞️ I am looking for people who will support me in every way.
- 📫 You can reach me via frtn0670@gmail.com.
